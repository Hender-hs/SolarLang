Notation varibles (varibles that doesn't store any value on memory, it will on serve as a notition - improvement of performance).
Example:
    string :firstName = "Alan";
    string :secondName = "Juice";
    string fullName = :firstName + :secondName;

It will work as notation. 
Reasons: In order to create a clean code, sometimes we need to declare more varibles in our code, thus loosing performance;
         This feature come in to solve this problem.
